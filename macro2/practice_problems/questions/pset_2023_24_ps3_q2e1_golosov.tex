Slide 16 Exercise: Set up a competitive equilibrium version of this economy (i.e. intermediary firms act competitively) with inelastic supply.

(a) Show that this equilibrium is always efficient.

(b) Show that $P / W$ in competitive equilibrium differs from $P / W$ in monopolistic equilibrium even when labor is inelastic. How do you reconcline this with the fact that both equilibria are efficient in this case?
