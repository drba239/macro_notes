Slide 19 Exercise 2: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The optimum policy is to subsidize labor, $\tau<0$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Monopolist under-employs labor, relative to efficient allocation.
        \item The optimum policy subsidizes labor supply to offset this distortion.
        \item Labor subsidies are financed with lump-sum taxes.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Note that the optimal tax is independent of the elasticity of the labor supply
\end{itemize}

How do you reconcile this observation with the fact that monopolistic equilibrium is efficient when labor supply is inelastic?
