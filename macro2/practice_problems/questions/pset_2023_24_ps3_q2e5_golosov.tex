Slide 20 Exercise

\begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose we change the setup of Slide 3 by assuming the intermediate firm $i$ has productivity $A_i$.
    \item Keep the rest of the assumptions unchanged.
    \item Demand from final good firms is unchanged:
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
    Y = \left(\frac{P}{P_i}\right)^{-\sigma}C_i
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exercise: Show that the markup is constant in the model with heterogeneous firms:
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
    P_i = \underbrace{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}}_{\text{markup}} \times \underbrace{\frac{W}{A_i}}_{\text{marginal cost of } i}
\end{align}
